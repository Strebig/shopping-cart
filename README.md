# Shopping Cart - AS SEEN ON TV E-Commerce!

A full stack LAMP & React shopping cart app.

## Introduction

*** FOR DEMO PURPOSES ONLY!***

This is a single-page React application with a dynamic PHP API. The products displayed, checkout information, and items bought on a successful checkout are stored in the MySQL Database. 

## Getting Started

1. Browse Products on the main screen & detailed product page, and decide how many you would like to "buy".

2. Check your shopping cart to see if this is the correct amount of items that you wanted, and if you would like to remove any from the cart.

3. Continue to the checkout screen and input `fake information for the demo` in order to checkout successfully.

4. If all input fields are filled out correctly, SUCCESS! You have successfully gone through the demo and your fake information is uploaded to the database.
